### Validator Testing 

## Js Hint:
- https://jshint.com/

The warnings for JS were unnecessary, due to differing ECMAScript 6 features and global variables. (source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27441803/why-does-jshint-throw-a-warning-if-i-am-using-const , https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17359232/how-to-tell-jshint-to-ignore-all-undefined-variables-in-one-file)

Otherwise, JS was correct.
